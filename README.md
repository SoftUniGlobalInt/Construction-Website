Explain the topic of your web site

The purpose of this project is to create a company website for a construction company.

The website represents a fictional construction company and includes:

- a home page with general company information

- a services page describing the offered construction services

- an about page presenting the company’s background and values

- a contacts page with communication details

- a news page with updates and announcements

The goal is to build a realistic multi-page website using HTML and CSS, while following a proper Git and GitHub workflow and deploying the site to Netlify.
